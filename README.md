## Hey!
I'm a Helsinki-based (soon Oulu), newly baked Software Developer looking for opportunities. Hence, **looking for work** mainly in **Oulu area and remotely**!

### About
- Entry/trainee level, looking for the first shot.
- Currently working to build a shell interpreter in C. 
- I'm studying software development in Hive Helsinki (42 schools) and CS at Tampere University.
- I'm most competent in C, but I write baby-level Python and Rust. Developing these skills as we speak, Rust via Docker + WASM sandboxing, Python and C++ in university.
- I'm interested in helping with Free / Open source projects. For now, I feel most confident helping with testing, documentation or translation in general, and why not some bug-hunting in C codebases.

Don't hesitate to reach out here or via my socials.
